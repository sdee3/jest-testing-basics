# Jest Testing Basics
A personal project / showcase of Jest

## What's Jest?
Jest is a zero-configuration testing platform. Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated "zero-configuration" experience. We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in more stable and healthy code bases.
